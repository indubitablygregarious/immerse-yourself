I kicked off the Immerse Yourself project today with the initial commit — got the foundational environments set up including battle, camping, chill, dungeon, tavern, town, and travel scenes, each with their own Spotify playlists and WIZ bulb lighting configs. I spent a good chunk of time tweaking the lighting across different environments, slowing down the battle cycle time and making the dungeon torches less erratic. I added a "win dungeon" victory variant and created two new tavern environments — a dark tavern and a mountain tavern — to give more mood options for social scenes. The tavern torch lights got a randomization pass to feel more natural, like the dungeon's. I also reordered the dungeon startup so the atmosphere kicks in before the sound effect, which felt better in practice. Toward the end of the session I added error handling across all ten scene files so the app wouldn't crash when sound effect files were missing, and updated the .gitignore to keep audio files out of the repo until I could create originals.
