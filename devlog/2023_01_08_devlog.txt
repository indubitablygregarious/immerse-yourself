Late night coding session that turned into an early morning one. I started by adding a night town theme, which was something I'd been wanting for a while -- darker, moodier lighting for those after-dark urban scenes. Then I did a big DRY refactor across all the environment scripts to pull out the repeated bulb initialization code, which cleaned up a ton of duplication across 15 files. Made camping darker while I was in there since it always felt too bright. After that I added a travel_night environment for nighttime overland journeys, and fixed a quick Spotify URI bug in the summer festival script. Four commits in about an hour, mostly because the refactor made everything so much cleaner to work with going forward.
