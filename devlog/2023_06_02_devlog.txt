Quick session today -- added a spooky travel environment for those creepy overland journeys through haunted forests or cursed wastelands. It's a full 114-line environment with its own eerie lighting and dark playlist. I also added a simple one-line boat alias so you can launch the travel_boat environment with a shorter name. Sometimes the smallest quality-of-life things are the most satisfying to add.
