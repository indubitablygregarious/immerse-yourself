Big infrastructure change today -- I added battlefield_bulbs support across all 23 environment scripts. Up until now I only had backdrop and overhead bulb groups, but having a dedicated third group for the battlefield/table area opens up a lot more dramatic lighting possibilities, especially for combat scenes. The battle_dungeon, dungeon, and town_night environments got the most attention with 8 lines of changes each to really take advantage of the new bulb group. Most of the other files just needed a small 3-line addition to read the new bulb config and include them. It was tedious touching every single environment file, but now every scene can light the play area independently from the room lighting, which is exactly what I wanted for those intense combat encounters.
