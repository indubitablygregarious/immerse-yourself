I spent the day building out desert and travel scenes. Started by tweaking the travel script with some lighting improvements, then created a full travel_desert environment with all the backdrop lighting dialed in. Had to fix the desert backdrop right after since something was off. Later in the evening I went on a roll and added a battle_desert scene, a travel_night_desert variant, and fixed the camping playlist. Ended the night by swapping in a strictly fire playlist for camping because the old one just wasn't cutting it. All in all, a solid day of expanding the environment library with new desert-themed content.
