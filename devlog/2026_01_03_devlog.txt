# 2026-01-03

Absolutely massive day of development -- probably the most productive single day this project has ever seen. I started after midnight by converting the whole project into a proper application architecture with a config loader, engine modules for sound/lights/Spotify, a lighting daemon, YAML configs for all 50+ environments, a Makefile, tests, and complete documentation. That single commit alone was over 4,300 lines of new code across 66 files. Then throughout the day I just kept going: added dark mode support, emoji icons for every button, a fuzzy search feature, category grouping in the sidebar, a settings dialog for light/dark theme, a stop button for music, and async lighting improvements. I also created new environments like hell, heaven, and beach day. Fixed the sound-only button behavior so it properly re-highlights the active lights config when a sound effect finishes playing. Spent time on visual polish too -- making background emojis and keyboard shortcut badges scale with the interface size. By the end of the night I had made 26 commits and transformed the project from a simple launcher into a full-featured GUI application.
