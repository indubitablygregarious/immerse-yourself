Another marathon session that started just after midnight and went until late afternoon. Early in the morning I added a bunch of new environments -- travel_dawn, travel_afternoon, beach_afternoon, beach_night, travel_rainy, travel_storm, forest, applause, and woohoo. I also built out proper settings dialogs for configuring Spotify and WIZ bulb credentials right from the GUI, which was a big usability win. Spent a lot of time refining the search bar -- improving its effectiveness, fixing how it interacts with keyboard shortcuts, and updating the styling. I added an "off" type for light groups so you can selectively shut off certain bulbs, and made all the night-themed environments significantly darker. The Spotify engine got some nice improvements too: shuffle is now automatically enabled and it immediately skips to a random track for maximum variety on startup. The biggest chunk of work was the Spotify connection handling on startup -- over 1,100 new lines dealing with OAuth flow and auto-playing a travel environment when the app launches. Finished the day with a small library playlist fix and making the search focus on the result button so you can just hit enter to activate it.
