Today was all about atmosphere and status feedback. I built a proper status bar system that can display multiple statuses simultaneously with icons and helpful mouseover tooltips -- about 236 lines of new status bar code. Then I added freesound.org URL support to the config loader and sound engine, which was a big deal because it means environments can now reference online sounds that get auto-downloaded and cached. Updated a ton of environment configs to use the new freesound URL format. In the evening I went further and built out the full atmosphere engine (273 lines) and a freesound manager module (274 lines) for handling downloads, metadata extraction, and caching. This was a foundational day -- the atmosphere system opens up the ability to have rich layered ambient soundscapes running alongside the music and lights, which is exactly what the project needed to feel truly immersive.
