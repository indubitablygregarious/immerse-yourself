Today was a massive overhaul day for the atmosphere system. I started the morning by reworking the atmospheric engine so that looped atmosphere sounds could be highlighted and made modular -- the idea being you can layer individual ambient sounds on top of each other. Then I added volume sliders for each atmospheric sound in the mix, which was something I'd been wanting for a while since some sounds just overpower others. The big commit of the day was updating all 40+ environment configs to use freesound mixes instead of relying on Spotify for ambient audio, which touched basically every YAML file in the project plus a brand new download queue system for fetching sounds from freesound.org. I also built out the freesound manager with dynamic category creation based on tags, so downloaded sounds automatically sort themselves into the right categories. Wrapped up the evening by polishing the download animation in the launcher. It was one of those days where I barely looked up from the screen -- over 3,000 lines changed across 42 files in the biggest commit alone.
