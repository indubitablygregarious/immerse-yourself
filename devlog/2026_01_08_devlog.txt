This was an absolute marathon day -- I barely slept and just kept cranking out environments and features from midnight through the evening. I started by reorganizing all the environment categories across 56 config files, then built a whole sound_conf system so that entry sounds can randomly pick from a collection of variants (squeaky doors, battle intros, transitions, applause, victory fanfares). Then I went on a massive environment creation spree, adding around 60 new configs for places like blacksmiths, prisons, temples, throne rooms, swamps, graveyards, and time-of-day variants for a bunch of existing scenes. I also added a Claude skill for creating new environments to make that process faster going forward. On the code side, I fixed the search to use all metadata fields, fixed the fade-to-warm-white issue during scene transitions, switched the UI to PyQt6, added macOS font alternatives, and built a config setting to ignore SSL errors for freesound downloads. The battle environments got their Spotify playlists back because atmosphere-only felt too thin for combat. By evening I was polishing the download animations and calling it done -- easily the most productive single day on this project.
