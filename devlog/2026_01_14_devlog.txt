Came back after a few days off and worked on polishing the UI and content organization. I added a new sounds badge indicator so users can see at a glance which environments have sound effects, and reorganized a bunch of environment categories so that sound-only configs live in proper sound categories. Updated about 25 environment configs to fix their category assignments -- things like blacksmith, docks, library, and shop variants all got recategorized. I also finally added the sepia environment that I'd apparently forgotten to include earlier, which is a pretty beefy 146-line config. Did some cleanup on the freesound manager as well. Most of the launcher changes were UI improvements, adding around 170 lines for the badge system and better category handling.
