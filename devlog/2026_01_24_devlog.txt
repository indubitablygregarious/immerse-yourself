Big architectural day. I switched the package manager from pip to uv and migrated from PyQt6 to PySide6, which involved updating imports across the launcher, download queue, freesound manager, and status bar. Added a proper pyproject.toml and uv.lock file to replace the old requirements.txt files. But the real star of the day was the time-of-day system -- I consolidated all the separate time variant files (morning, afternoon, night versions of environments) into inline time_variants blocks within each base config. Wrote a consolidation script and then applied it across the entire config library, merging about 60 separate time-variant files back into their parent configs. The result was a net change of over 13,000 lines across 78 files, but the config directory is way cleaner now with each environment as a single self-contained YAML file. I also added 305 lines to the launcher for the time-of-day UI bar and the config loader got new resolution logic for picking the right variant at runtime.
