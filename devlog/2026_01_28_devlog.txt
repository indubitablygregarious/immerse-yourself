Late night session focused on consolidating and improving the environment library. I merged several travel-specific environments into more general ones -- travel_boat became just "boat", travel_snow became "snow", and the travel_desert variants got folded into a proper "desert" environment. Added a big new ocean environment with 405 lines of config. Reworked the beach config significantly, expanding it from a basic setup to a much richer 120-line addition with better time variants. Deleted a handful of redundant configs like travel_dawn, travel_desert, and travel_night_desert since those are now handled by the time-of-day system in their parent configs. The launcher got a major update too, about 500 lines of changes improving the time-of-day buttons and the general button layout. Also updated the freesound search skill and tweaked the atmosphere engine to handle the new setups.
