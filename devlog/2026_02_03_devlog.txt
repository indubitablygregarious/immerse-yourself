This was probably the biggest single day of the entire project so far. I started at 1 AM by doing a massive code cleanup -- extracting classes into separate files, DRYing up the codebase, and pulling the 5000+ line launcher.py monolith into a proper gui package with configs, dialogs, styles, threads, and widget modules. Then I refactored the whole GUI into a proper Model-View-Controller architecture with an AppModel for centralized state, a MainView for pure UI rendering, and controllers for orchestration, environment management, and startup logic. After all that Python restructuring, I pivoted to Rust and built the entire initial Rust application in one go -- immerse-core with config loading, validators, all four engines (atmosphere, lights, sound, spotify), a download queue, and an FFI layer, plus immerse-desktop and immerse-daemon crates. That was over 5,500 new lines of Rust. Then I added a Nuitka build script for compiling the Python app to a C binary, added volume sliders to loop buttons in the Rust app, and fixed atmosphere fadeout volume issues. To cap it all off, I created the Tauri application from scratch with a React TypeScript frontend -- complete with category sidebar, environment grid, search bar, stop buttons, settings dialog, time-of-day bar, and a now-playing widget. By the end of the night I was bringing the Tauri features closer to parity with the Python app, adding a status bar, time variant dialog, and over 500 lines of CSS. Absolutely insane amount of work across Python, Rust, TypeScript, and CSS.
