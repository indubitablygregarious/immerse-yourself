Another long day grinding on the Tauri app to get it closer to feature parity with the Python version. Started just after midnight bringing the category sidebar, time-of-day bar, and atmosphere engine up to par with the Python behavior, then updated the docs with all the new architecture info. Spent a good chunk of time tweaking styles and CSS for the Rust app -- the commit message "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" at 1 AM probably captures my mood pretty well at that point. Got exit light colors matching the Python app (warm white on quit), fixed the atmosphere cleanup on exit, and then moved into the afternoon working on button UX improvements with better volume sliders, status bar updates, and environment button behavior. Fixed a bug where the settings dialog wasn't appearing, improved the UI scaling, and got light engine quit behavior working properly. Wrapped up the evening by implementing the full settings dialog with Spotify, WIZ bulbs, and downloads panels -- that one commit alone was 870 lines. Also added the light/dark/system theme toggle with a proper ThemeContext in React.
