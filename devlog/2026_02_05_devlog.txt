Split my time between iOS CI/CD and Tauri feature work today. Started in the early morning hours by setting up a GitHub Actions workflow for iOS builds with all the code signing infrastructure, then built a cool new lighting preview widget for the Tauri app that visually shows the current light animation colors. Fixed the Spotify integration in the Tauri backend -- both the engine communication and the controls were broken, so that took two commits to sort out. Also fixed one-shot sounds not working properly in the Tauri app. On the iOS side, it was a bit of a battle with code signing -- I went through several rounds of fixes for the CI workflow, dealing with bundle IDs, Rust toolchain action names, release flag issues, manual signing vs automatic, provisioning profile UUIDs, and pbxproj patching. Merged the first pull request on the project for the iOS GitHub Actions setup. In between the CI debugging I managed to fix search keyboard shortcuts and do some CSS cleanup for the Tauri frontend.
