What a day -- this was mostly an iOS build marathon with a lot of side quests. I spent the first chunk of the day wrestling with iOS code signing in the CI pipeline, going through round after round of fixes: injecting manual signing into the pbxproj, removing duplicate release flags, preserving the keychain list, gating desktop-only menu code behind cfg(desktop), adding platform fallbacks for the Spotify engine, fixing the export with an ExportOptions.plist, and bundling env configs properly with SOURCE_ROOT paths. I must have pushed a dozen commits just for iOS CI fixes. In between all that, I added a tablet mode to the Tauri UI with responsive layout changes, built some nice tooltips for the environment buttons in both the Python and Tauri apps, wrote a demo script, sped up CI by switching to cargo-binstall for the Tauri CLI (10 seconds vs 8 minutes compiling from source), and bumped the version three times for TestFlight uploads. Also got the mobile viewport and fullscreen settings working, added a settings entry in the category sidebar menu for mobile, made the now-playing widget more compact, and added a concurrency guard to the iOS workflow. Ended the day by adding local macOS iOS build targets to the Makefile so I don't always have to go through CI.
