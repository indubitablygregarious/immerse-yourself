Huge day — probably the most productive session in a while. I started by adding new environments: a circus scene, a river environment with full time variants, and fireball and snow sound effects with their own sound_conf collections. I also warmed up the sepia lighting config. Then I went on a major cleanup spree — archived the original Python implementation and the old Rust egui prototype into an `archive/` directory and simplified the Makefile down to just the Tauri app. It felt good to finally cut the dead weight.

I fixed a bunch of bugs: atmosphere fadeout wasn't working properly, category selection after search was broken, and the category sidebar had a hover bold bug. The loading flow got a significant overhaul too. I created the devlog skill and generated entries for every previous day of development going back to January 2023 — three years of history captured. I also set up the ios-release skill and merged the iOS GitHub Actions branch.

In the evening I removed the yt-dlp dependency from the freesound downloader (one less external binary to worry about) and did a massive documentation pass — rewrote the README, CLAUDE.md, and added READMEs throughout the entire codebase. I built a full Docker-based E2E test suite with automated screenshot capture using the WebKit Inspector Protocol, which was a real adventure in figuring out how WebKitGTK's inspector actually works. Capped the night off by adding an in-memory debug log infrastructure for iOS diagnostics, since I can't exactly open a terminal on my iPhone. Pushed 0.3.2 and 0.3.3 to TestFlight.
