Today was split between two very different halves. The first half was all iOS polish — I added a pause/play toggle for atmosphere sounds and disabled keyboard shortcuts on mobile since they were interfering with touch input. I also added a cache management panel in settings so users can clear downloaded sounds and have it properly reload configs and refresh the frontend. Then I went through several rounds of TestFlight builds (0.3.11 through 0.3.14) fixing iOS-specific issues like the safe area layout where the top bar was hiding behind the notch and there was wasted space at the bottom. I also fixed virtual loop configs so they skip uncached freesound URLs instead of showing broken entries.

The second half of the day took a completely different turn — I convened the full virtual executive board to research commercialization. Six parallel research agents dug into everything from TTRPG market size ($2.4B and growing) to Gumroad's license key API, freesound.org licensing risks, secret scanning tools, and open-source marketing strategies. The big takeaway: our smart light integration is genuinely unique in this space, but we have a critical blocker in the freesound license audit before we can sell anything. I set up a private strategy repo (immerse-yourself-strategy) to keep the competitive intelligence and business planning separate from the public codebase, wrote up a public-facing roadmap for the product repo, and updated the ask-xteam skill so future board meetings build on prior research instead of starting from scratch each time.
