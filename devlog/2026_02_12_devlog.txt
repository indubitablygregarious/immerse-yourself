# 2026-02-12

Late night session that turned into a surprisingly productive one. The big feature was implementing a user content directory — a platform-standard location where users can drop in their own environment configs, sound collections, and audio files alongside the built-in content. This required reworking the ConfigLoader to support multiple directories with override-by-filename semantics, extending the SoundEngine's path resolution chain, and wiring it all through AppState. I also added a "User Content" panel in Settings with an "Open Folder" button so people can actually find the directory. On the business side, I dug deep into freesound.org's terms of service to understand the legal landscape around redistributing their audio in commercial products — turns out there's a platform-level API license on top of the individual Creative Commons licenses that needs to be resolved before shipping anything premium. I made decisions on how to handle attribution for the CC-BY sounds (bundled license file, in-app credits window, and per-sound tooltips), broke that into trackable issues, and set up proper time tracking. Updated the roadmap and documentation to reflect where things actually stand now. It's 1am and I should probably stop.
