Big content packaging day. I bundled all 277 free-tier atmosphere sounds as MP3 files into the repo using Git LFS — split into cc0/ and cc-by/ directories with a manifest.json that maps freesound URLs to local paths so the app can skip downloads entirely for bundled sounds. Had to audit and replace all the CC-BY-NC licensed audio with CC0 or CC-BY alternatives to keep the licensing clean for distribution. Generated proper ATTRIBUTION.md and attribution.json for the CC-BY credits. On the private repo side, I moved all the legacy code and build artifacts into an archive/ directory now that the public repo is the canonical home for app code. Also squeezed in a few UI fixes — improved the environment description box styling, bumped iOS to 0.3.18 for TestFlight, and fixed a bug where hovering over volume sliders on loop sound buttons would cause the button and its entire grid row to jitter and resize.
