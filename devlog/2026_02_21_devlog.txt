Spent the whole session on the audio distribution rights audit — finding CC-0 replacements for all the bundled sound effects that had unclear licensing. Replaced 16 sounds across both repos with CC-0 alternatives sourced from Freesound: things like sword whoosh, rimshot, sad trombone, gasp, dramatic sting, church bells, crickets, applause, and more. The heartbeat/flatline and magic sparkle sounds took the most iteration — went through probably 8 rounds of candidates for each before landing on ones that felt right. The laugh track was the trickiest of all — ended up layering three separate CC-0 crowd laughter recordings at different volumes to get a natural sitcom feel. Moved the children yay and bruh sounds to a non-free directory since we couldn't find good replacements, and removed 9 other non-redistributable sound files from tracking entirely. The audio audit is essentially done now.
