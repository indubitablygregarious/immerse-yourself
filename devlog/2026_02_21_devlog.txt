Spent the whole session on the audio distribution rights audit — finding CC-0 replacements for all the bundled sound effects that had unclear licensing. Replaced 16 sounds across both repos with CC-0 alternatives sourced from Freesound: things like sword whoosh, rimshot, sad trombone, gasp, dramatic sting, church bells, crickets, applause, and more. The heartbeat/flatline and magic sparkle sounds took the most iteration — went through probably 8 rounds of candidates for each before landing on ones that felt right. The laugh track was the trickiest of all — ended up layering three separate CC-0 crowd laughter recordings at different volumes to get a natural sitcom feel. Moved the children yay and bruh sounds to a non-free directory since we couldn't find good replacements, and removed 9 other non-redistributable sound files from tracking entirely. The audio audit is essentially done now.

Later I also did a full cross-reference of the Sacred & Arcane pack's ATTRIBUTION.md against every sound URL in the YAML configs — confirmed all 99 CC-BY sounds are properly credited and the 20 "missing" ones are all CC0, so no gaps. Updated the desktop-release skill to auto-generate release notes from commits between tags, grouping them into user-facing categories. Then I cut v0.4.0 as a minor bump — felt right given the new About & Credits panel and the licensing cleanup. All three platform builds passed, release notes attached on GitHub. On the strategy side, I updated the action plan and week 1 status with the build/release progress, and logged some research time on a multi-source audio finding skill. Finally, I added post-commit git hooks to both the app and strategy repos that use Claude to automatically check if CLAUDE.md and README.md are stale after each commit — if they are, the hook updates the docs and pushes a follow-up commit. Should keep documentation from drifting out of date without any manual effort.
